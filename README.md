On reading the description, it is very clear that we must predict who are the **people most likely to survive**. And we are given these variables.

## Dependent Variables

* Passenger Id
* A proxy for socio-economic status (SES) (class)
* Name
* Sex
* Age
* Traveled with  sibling or spouse
* Traveled with  parent or child
* Ticket
* Fair
* Cabin No.
* Embarked
